Solution:
val p15nyse = spark.read.option("inferSchema","true").csv("/public/nyse")
val p15nyseSym = spark.read.option("inferSchema","true")
                           .option("header","true")
                           .option("sep","\t")
                           .csv("/public/nyse_symbols")
val p15join = p15nyse.join(p15nyseSym,'_c0 === 'Symbol,"left_anti")
                     .select('_c0.as("stock_ticker")).distinct
p15join.write.avro("/user/username/problem15/solution/")

Results:
scala> spark.read.avro("/user/username/problem15/solution/").show
