Description

    We all know that it was 4 way contest at the time of 2014 General elections between BJP, BSP, INC and SP
    Now UP State elections are underway and it is 3 way contest between BJP, BSP and SP+INC
    Let us understand how many seats each party would have won in the 3 way contest
    Data contains header
    This is to just implement Scala and Spark with interesting use case

Problem Statement

    In 4 way contest BJP won almost 90% of seats in general elections
    If it was 3 way contest as UP state elections 2017, then how many seats BJP would have won, how many seats SP+INC should have won.
    Github link for data set â€“ https://github.com/hadoopbase/dataset/blob/master/ls2014.tsv
    There are ~8K records, open the file, copy the data and paste into file on your machine
    Data is tab separated
    First record give the details about data, discard it while processing
    Data has details about all Lok Sabha constituencies in India, we are only interested in UP
    There are multiple records for each constituency, each record have details about state, constituency, candidate name, party, number of votes he got
    Get the votes of BJP, BSP and cumulative votes of INC+SP
    Final outcome, number of seats BJP, BSP and INC+SP assuming alliance

Solution:

val p23df = spark.read.option("sep","\t")
                      .option("inferSchema","true")
                      .option("header","true").csv("/user/mearu0705/election.csv")
val p23df1=p23df.filter("partyname in ('BJP','BSP','INC','SP')")
                .select( when (('partyname==="INC" || 'partyname==="SP"),"ALLY".otherwise('partyname).as("party"),'total)
                .groupBy('party).agg(sum('total).alias("no_of_seats"))
                
Results:
scala> p23df1.show
+-----+-----------+
|party|no_of_seats|
+-----+-----------+
|  BJP|  161047761|
| ALLY|  115274317|
|  BSP|   22434033|
+-----+-----------+
